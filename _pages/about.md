I am an Information Technology (`IT`) Engineer with a Bachelorâ€™s degree from [`Islamic Azad University, Najafabad Branch`](https://iaun.iau.ir/en), one of the leading universities in Iran/Isfahan. My academic background and research interests are deeply rooted in the fields of <b>machine vision</b>, <b>deep learning</b>, and <b>neural networks</b>. During my studies, I specialized in developing innovative solutions for real-world problems, with a focus on <b>medical imaging</b> and <b>AI-driven systems</b>.

My undergraduate <b>thesis</b> involved the `Semantic segmentation of breast cancer pathology images using the U-Net model`, where I worked on improving the accuracy and efficiency of detecting and classifying cancerous tissues. This project gave me hands-on experience in <b>deep learning models</b>, particularly in <b>image processing</b> and <b>medical diagnostics</b>. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience that further fueled my passion for applying AI to healthcare and other impactful industries.

I am passionate about staying at the forefront of technology and continue to expand my knowledge through independent research and development. In the future, I aim to contribute to cutting-edge innovations in AI, with a particular focus on its applications in healthcare, robotics, and smart systems.
