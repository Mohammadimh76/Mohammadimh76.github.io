## Problem

Vision is one of the most important special senses, not only because it plays a crucial role in connecting us with the external environment, but also because visual impairment can significantly reduce learning capabilities. While diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular conditions have the highest prevalence rates, eye diseases remain among the most significant health issues affecting many individuals.<br>
Many eye diseases, if left untreated (especially during childhood), can lead to blindness and cause irreversible problems, creating numerous limitations in patients’ personal and social lives. Therefore, early identification and diagnosis of diseases has always been crucial. This invention aims to achieve early detection of such conditions while emphasizing preventive strategies to identify diseases and their underlying risk factors.<br>

### Understanding

Heterochromia is a term describing differences in iris color within an individual. Central heterochromia occurs when different colors appear in the same eye, while complete heterochromia is when each eye has a different color. This condition results from variations in melanin concentration and distribution—the pigment responsible for skin, hair, and eye color.<br>
Eye color is determined by melanin storage in the iris, which controls pupil dilation to regulate light entry. Blue eyes have minimal melanin, while brown eyes are melanin-rich.<br>
The iris, the most visible part of the human eye, originates from the choroid layer and consists of blood vessels and connective tissue. Melanocytes produce melanin pigment, and other pigmented cells determine eye color. The iris contains smooth muscles that control light passage by adjusting pupil size—the opening in the iris center. This process regulates light reaching the retina.<br>

### Anatomical

The iris comprises two distinct layers with different embryonic origins:<br>
- Anterior margin: Composed of stroma—a loose layer containing connective tissue with melanocytes and non-pigmented cells
- Posterior surface: Covered by densely packed pigmented epithelial cells forming two tightly connected layers

Eye color differences result from pigmentation levels in the deep stromal layer, primarily the anterior margin and stromal density, controlling light absorption and reflection from the iris.

### Types
Heterochromia can indicate other underlying conditions. Early detection during infancy and childhood can be crucial. Associated conditions include:
- Bloch-Sulzberger syndrome
- Bourneville disease
- Hirschsprung disease
- Horner’s syndrome
- Parry-Romberg syndrome
- Sturge-Weber syndrome
- von Recklinghausen disease
- Waardenburg syndrome

Acquired heterochromia develops later in life due to disease, injury, or medication, while congenital heterochromia is present from birth or has genetic origins.<br>
Central heterochromia features two different colors in one iris—typically an outer ring of one color and an inner ring of another, often called “cat eyes.” The outer color is considered the true eye color and occurs more frequently in irises with low melanin levels.<br>
Sectoral heterochromia (partial heterochromia) appears as an irregular spot in the iris rather than a ring around the pupil.<br>

### Innovation
This innovation develops a precise system using engineering sciences to:

1. Enable early detection of eye diseases, focusing on heterochromia in infancy
2. Identify underlying diseases and pathogenic factors associated with this condition
3. Utilize AI algorithms to improve diagnosis and reduce human error
4. Provide completely non-invasive diagnosis and identification
5. Monitor all eye parameters and diseases related to size, color, and uniformity

By achieving early detection with high accuracy during infancy, this system helps treat underlying conditions and prevents the progression and complications arising from undiagnosed heterochromia.
