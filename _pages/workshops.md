    <h4>An introduction to computation for contemporary science</h4>
    <p>From climate change to COVID, computation is an essential element of modern science.  It allows us to find insights in a sea of data, ask principled questions about the future, and perform experiments without a laboratory.  In this class, weâ€™ll learn the practice of python programming, and quantitative questioning, through both data-driven and model-oriented case studies focused on the earth, the universe, and living systems.
